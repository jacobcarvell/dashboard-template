# Dashboard Template

This is a template for a geologist's dashboard. It is built on php scripts for querying geological data. The php scripts hosted here have all of the SQL queries commented out and dummy data output for display purposes. It uses chart.js for all of the charts as well as bootstrap and jquery. A custom table generator for generating tables from JSON is included.

Check out a live demo [here](https://jacobcarvell.github.io/dashboard-template/)

Please open an issue here on GitHub if you have any suggestions or problems with the theme.
